# AstroSR
This is our work in the paper " AstroSRï¼šA Dataset of Galaxy Images for Astronomical Super-Resolution Research". In this paper, we create a dataset for studying the quality transformation of different surveys, AstroSR, using the galaxy images from overlapping regions from Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey (HSC) and Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).
